The aim of this project is to investigate whether adding cryptocurrencies in a portfolio of traditional assets enhances the portfolio performance or not. 
A total of 18 cryptocurrencies have been included based on their market capitalization.
The data was obtained from Yahoo Finance with start date from 01st January 2014 to 28th February 2020.
I have employed the Markowitz Mean-Variance Analysis and Sharpe ratio to compute the mean returns, standard deviation. 
3 portfolios have been created with an intention to maximize Sharpe ratio.
